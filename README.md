# Alien_Invasion

This project will be using Pygame package to develop a 2d game
The goal of the game is to shoot down a fleet of aliens as they
drop down the screen, in levels that increase in speed and difficulty


In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom 
center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow 
keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills
the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens.
If the player destroys all the aliens, a new fleet appears, and they move faster than the 
previous fleet. If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, 
the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
